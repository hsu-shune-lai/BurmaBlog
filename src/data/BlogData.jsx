    description: `Bagan is an ancient city located in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar. 
      From the 9th to the 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom, 
      the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute modern Myanmar. 
      During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, over 10,000 Buddhist 
      temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which 
      the remains of over 2,200 temples and pagodas survive to the present day. 
      The Bagan Archaeological Zone is a main attraction for the country's nascent tourism industry. 
      The ruins of Bagan have been the subject of continuous study, and they hold significant 
      importance for Myanmar's cultural heritage and national identity.`,
